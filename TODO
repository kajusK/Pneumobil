FW
==
- Comm session layer should allow multiple responses to single command (eg. senging status as broadcast and collecting replies)

- Comm layer should run in it's own thread and communicatie using fifo or something like that, currently all communicating
threads must have large stack to contain whole comm calltrace

- Optimize stack usage

- Refactor GUI - each module should only contain init function that fills structure with
calls to on select, button update, etc. This structure is given to tab_register or
something like that

- migrate from uGFX to littlevgl


HW
==
- SDU has inverted order of DSUB 9 interface connector
- Remake PSU - burning MCU and 12 V is not able to supply enough current for horn (1,5 A).
- Update ECU to support servo control (automatic shifting)
- Update ECU to support polarity change of the Brake signal
- Update ECU to wire horn control through MCU
- Replace TSV912 by TS912 (working on higher voltages)
